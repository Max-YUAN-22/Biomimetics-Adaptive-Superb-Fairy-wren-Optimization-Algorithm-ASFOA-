# Biomimetics-Adaptive Superb Fairy-wren Optimization Algorithm（ASFOA）
A Novel Adaptive Superb Fairy-Wren (Malurus cyaneus) Optimization Algorithm for Solving Numerical Optimization Problems

Abstract
Superb Fairy-wren Optimization Algorithm (SFOA) is an animal-based meta-heuristic
algorithm derived from Fairy-wren’s behavior of growing, feeding, and avoiding natural
enemies. The SFOA has some shortcomings when facing complex environments. Its
switching mechanism is not enough to adapt to complex optimization problems, and it
faces a weakening of population diversity in the late stage of optimization, leading to a
higher possibility of falling into local optima. In addition, its global search ability needs to
be improved. To address the above deficiencies, this paper proposes an Adaptive Superb
Fairy-wren Optimization Algorithm (ASFOA). To assess the ability of the proposed ASFOA,
three groups of experiments are conducted in this paper. Firstly, the effectiveness of the
proposed improved strategies is checked on the CEC2018 test set. Second, the ASFOA is
compared with eight classical/highly cited/newly proposed metaheuristics on the CEC2018
test set, in which the ASFOA performed the best overall, with average rankings of 1.621,
1.138, 1.483, and 1.966 in the four-dimensional cases, respectively. Then the convergence
and robustness of ASFOA is verified on the CEC2022 test set. The experimental results
indicate that the proposed ASFOA is a competitive metaheuristic algorithm variant with
excellent performance in terms of convergence and distribution of solutions. In addition,
we further validate the ability of ASFOA to solve real optimization problems. The average
ranking of the proposed ASFOA on 10 engineering constrained optimization problems is
1.500. In summary, ASFOA is a promising variant of metaheuristic algorithms.
