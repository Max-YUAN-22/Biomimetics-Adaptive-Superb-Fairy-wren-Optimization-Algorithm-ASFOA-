一种新的求解数值优化问题的自适应超级仙女鹪鹩优化算法

Abstract
Superb Fairy-wren Optimization Algorithm (SFOA) is an animal-based meta-heuristic
algorithm derived from Fairy-wren’s behavior of growing, feeding, and avoiding natural
enemies. The SFOA has some shortcomings when facing complex environments. Its
switching mechanism is not enough to adapt to complex optimization problems, and it
faces a weakening of population diversity in the late stage of optimization, leading to a
higher possibility of falling into local optima. In addition, its global search ability needs to
be improved. To address the above deficiencies, this paper proposes an Adaptive Superb
Fairy-wren Optimization Algorithm (ASFOA). To assess the ability of the proposed ASFOA,
three groups of experiments are conducted in this paper. Firstly, the effectiveness of the
proposed improved strategies is checked on the CEC2018 test set. Second, the ASFOA is
compared with eight classical/highly cited/newly proposed metaheuristics on the CEC2018
test set, in which the ASFOA performed the best overall, with average rankings of 1.621,
1.138, 1.483, and 1.966 in the four-dimensional cases, respectively. Then the convergence
and robustness of ASFOA is verified on the CEC2022 test set. The experimental results
indicate that the proposed ASFOA is a competitive metaheuristic algorithm variant with
excellent performance in terms of convergence and distribution of solutions. In addition,
we further validate the ability of ASFOA to solve real optimization problems. The average
ranking of the proposed ASFOA on 10 engineering constrained optimization problems is
1.500. In summary, ASFOA is a promising variant of metaheuristic algorithms.


摘要：
超级鹪鹩优化算法（SFOA）是一种基于动物的元启发式算法，该算法根据鹪鹩生长、觅食和躲避天敌的行为推导而来。SFOA在面对复杂环境时存在一些不足。其切换机制不足以适应复杂的优化问题，且在优化后期面临种群多样性减弱，陷入局部最优的可能性较大。此外，其全局搜索能力有待提高。针对上述不足，本文提出了一种自适应超级鹪鹩优化算法（ASFOA）。为了评估所提出的ASFOA的能力，本文进行了三组实验。首先，在CEC2018测试集上验证了改进策略的有效性。其次，将ASFOA与CEC2018测试集上的8种经典/高被引/新提出的元启发式方法进行比较，ASFOA在四维情况下的平均排名分别为1.621、1.138、1.483和1.966，整体表现最佳。在CEC2022测试集上验证了ASFOA算法的收敛性和鲁棒性。实验结果表明，本文提出的ASFOA是一种竞争性元启发式算法变体，在解的收敛性和分布性方面具有优异的性能。此外，我们进一步验证了ASFOA解决实际优化问题的能力。所提出的ASFOA在10个工程约束优化问题上的平均排名为1.500。综上所述，ASFOA是一种很有前途的元启发式算法。
