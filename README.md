# Adaptive Superb Fairy-Wren Optimization Algorithm (ASFOA)

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the **Adaptive Superb Fairy-Wren Optimization Algorithm (ASFOA)** for solving numerical optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the behavior of the Superb Fairy-wren and integrates three major strategies to improve global search and local exploitation.
